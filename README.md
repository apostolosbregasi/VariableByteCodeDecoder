# VariableByteCodeDecoder

This Java program allows users to input a Variable Byte Code and converts it into its decimal equivalent. 
The Variable Byte Code is a binary encoding scheme where certain bits are removed or adjusted based on specific rules. The program checks the validity of the input and performs the necessary decoding steps to obtain the decimal value.
